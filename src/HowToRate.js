  Your stakeholders will be rated on three dimensions, all in
  relation to your project. So once you have registered your
  project with a name and a description, you can register your
  stakeholders <a>here</a> and give them their initial ratings.

  <h3>Who is a project stakeholder?</h3>
  According to the Project Management Institute (PMI),
  the term project stakeholder refers to, "an individual,
  group, or organization, who may affect, be affected by,
  or perceive itself to be affected by a decision, activity,
  or outcome of a project".

  <h3>Example Stakeholders</h3>
  Top Management, e.g CEO, vice-presidents, directors and division managers,
  Your Manager and Your Sponsor, if not the same
  Your Peers
  Managers of resources needed for the project to be successful
  Internal and External Customers or governing bodies

  <h3>Power Rating</h3>
  The Power Rating represents a stakeholder's ability to
  block or advance your project. How much influence could
  they have on your project? Rate their power on a scale
  from 1-10.

  <h3>Interest Rating</h3>
  The Interest Rating represents a stakeholder's own interest
  in your project. Is their success dependent on yours? Then
  you would probably give them a high interest rating.

  <h3>Support Rating</h3>
  The Support Rating represents how supportive you perceive
  the stakeholder to be of your project. It is important
  to be honest and rate them according to what you actually
  think.

  <h3>Strategies</h3>
  Once you are finished with your ratings, you are likely
  to ask yourself which of the stakeholders you would like
  to re-position in any kind of rating. If a stakeholder has
  a lot of power over your project but little interest or
  a low support rating, it makes sense to try to get her
  or him more interested. This is when strategies come in
  that can help you move the stakeholders in the right
  direction.

  You can find some different strategies <a>here</a>
  and you can also record your own.

  <h3>ToDo-List</h3>
  Finally, we provide a simple ToDo-list for you to keep
  track of any actions you decide upon to execute the
  strategies.

  <h3>CONFIDENTIAL</h3>
  Remember your stakeholder analysis is confidential.
  You should typically not share it with more than one
  trusted person. It can be necessary to have a discussion
  around it sometimes but as the honesty of the ratings
  are crucial, it is important to keep your analysis
  confidential.
